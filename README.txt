The code for the supervised learning assignment is found at the following GitHub repository: https://github.com/brandonritchie/SupervisedLearningProject1.

A seperate python script was used for each dataset with the script names being churn_analysis.py and product_subscription_analysis.py.

The validation curves for each of the artificial neural networks take a significant amount of time to train, so datasets with pre-discovered results are provided 
and are called within the code.
